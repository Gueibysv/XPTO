XPTO Park – Parking Management Algorithm

🎓 Academic project developed for the Algorithms / Introduction to Programming course at ISPTEC, focused on the simulation of a parking management system using structured programming concepts.

The algorithm manages parking spaces across multiple floors, allowing automatic and manual control of parking slots.

📌 Project Overview

The XPTO Park algorithm simulates a parking lot with 4 floors (A, B, C, D), each containing 8 parking spaces.

Each parking space can be:

"O" → Available

"X" → Occupied

The system is menu-driven and allows users to interactively manage parking spaces.

🎯 Objectives

Practice use of arrays (vectors)

Apply conditional structures and loops

Develop a menu-based algorithm

Simulate a real-world parking scenario

Reinforce structured programming logic

🛠️ Concepts Used

Vectors (arrays)

Conditional statements

Repetition structures

Menu-driven program logic

⚙️ System Features

Display parking panel

Automatically select a parking floor with more free spaces

Manually occupy a parking space

Free an occupied parking space

Exit the system

🧱 System Logic

Floors are represented by vectors (A, B, C, D)

Parking availability is controlled using characters

User interaction is handled through a menu

🚧 Project Status

✅ Completed as an academic project
🔧 Possible improvements:

Input validation

Support for more floors and spaces

Conversion to a programming language (C / Java)

📚 Key Learnings

Logical problem-solving

Data representation using arrays

Algorithm design

User interaction through menus

📄 Academic Context

This project was developed exclusively for academic purposes as part of an Algorithms / Programming Fundamentals course at ISPTEC.
